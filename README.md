# Worlde Helper
This little app helps solving Wordle puzzles.
Just enter the word you guessed and the result the Wordle gave you, and you get back a list of possible solutions!
The main reason why I wrote this app was for training my React and Typescript skills. So it is, you guessed right, written with React and Typescript.

## To do
Possible improvements include the possibility to enter a second (third...) guess, and the translation to German. I will also try to use Redux under the hood just for learning purposes.
